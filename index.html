            FBDialogue is a browser extension aiming to simulate a real life conversation. <br>Any interaction happening on Facebook is today shaped by the standard, black-or-white options the social network is giving to you: would our Facebook conversations change, if we had to express ourselves just with words -no emoji, no GIFs allowed?<br>Would they change, also, if we really had to listen to other people - with a slow pace, one at a time? And what if we had no chance to delete or rethink what we just wrote - just as we can’t go back in time and change what we just said out loud?<br><br>FBDialogue makes everything on the social network that is not based on conceiving, reading, and commenting contents almost useless and unreachable.<br>It does not involve any pre-conceived expression (there’s no “I like it”, no “grr” reactions).<br>It makes listening and thinking quite necessary.<br>It makes endless scrolling quite useless and impossible.<br><br>At the place of contents, your feed consists of blank spaces, each one marking a post. Every post gets visible when you go over it, and disappears when you move to the following one. This means you can only read one content at a time: just as in real life you can’t listen to everything simultaneously. Comments follow the same logic: to listen to somebody, you’ll have to stop and pause every other noise.  If you wish to join the conversation, you’ll have to think of what you want to say first: in fact, you won’t be able to see what you are writing while you’re typing, but only once it’s published.<br>This way, a thoughtless comment is disencouraged, and so is a useless fight: if reading and writing is taking a bit of effort, you don’t want to waste your time posting and reading bullshit, do you?
